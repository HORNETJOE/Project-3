# Project-3
## Introduction
Project 3 is an application that will allow the user to enter three letters into an anagram solver which will then search through a three letter dictionary to find the biggest word it can make using those three letters.
## IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
the IDE that I used during the development of this application was a webpage called Repl.it.
