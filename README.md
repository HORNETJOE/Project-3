# Design Documentation
## Process of implementation Algorithm
the process of creating a application that could take three letters and then find the largest word it can using those three letters 
## Description of IDE used and features it provided
the IDE that was used was a website called Repl.it and it allowed me to write the program in the language I wanted and because it was located on a website i was able to access it anywhere that had internet connection.
## Debugging process and debugging facilities in your chosen IDE
the debugging process and debugging facilities in my chosen IDE helped when finding errors in the program and helped correct some minor mistakes made during the making of the program.
## Outlining Coding standards used with justification
Coding standards and needed when coding because it makes the code more understandable for other users looking the code or just updates and maintains of the code for the original creator. These standards can be shown through comments made on the code talking about what does what.
## Evaluation: How debugging process helped
the debugging process helped with fixing the code because it allowed me to see the errors in the code and correct them to keep the code working.
